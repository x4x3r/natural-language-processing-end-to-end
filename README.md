# natural-language-processing-end-to-end
This is a natural language processing end-to-end project (file:natural-language-processing.ipynb, work in progress), which starts with web scraping of website keyword metadata and proceeds to website classification and topic prediction (the website vertical) by using a set of scikit-learn models trained on a list of keywords (file: test-keyword-samples).
